The GRPO training rewards poems that match line counts but NOT the defining characteristics of each form.\n\n## Scope\n- 141 forms across 39 form files\n- O(1) or O(log N) NLP algorithms only - no neural network verification\n- Use existing constraint primitives where possible\n- Create new constraint types as needed\n- Cascade improvements across similar forms\n\n## Categories of Enhancement\n1. End-word rotation forms (Tritina, Quatina, Quintina)\n2. Refrain/repetition verification\n3. Rhyme scheme enforcement\n4. Syllable/meter patterns\n5. Acrostic and positional constraints\n6.
